                                <p>In this video, Hitesh introduces the basics of HTML
                                    (Hypertext Markup Language), one of the most essential elements of web
                                    <br> development.
                                    He explains the simple structure of an HTML document, which is divided
                                    into two main sections: the head and the body. The head contains
                                    metadata,<br>
                                    such as the document title, while the body contains visible content like
                                    headings (h1) and paragraphs. <br>
                                    Hitesh also discusses the use of VS Code and its Emmet abbreviation
                                    shortcuts to quickly generate HTML boilerplate code,<br>
                                    making development more efficient. He walks through the creation of a
                                    basic webpage, covering elements like the doctype, <br>
                                    which declares the version of HTML5, and the title and h1 tags.
                                    Additionally, Hitesh highlights the importance of writing semantic HTML
                                    <br>
                                    that works across various platforms, including screen readers and
                                    in-flight entertainment systems, ensuring accessibility and cross-device
                                    <br>compatibility.
                                    The video provides a strong foundation for understanding HTML structure
                                    and paves the way for exploring more advanced tags and web development
                                    techniques <br>
                                    in upcoming lessons. It's an excellent introduction for anyone starting
                                    with web development or frontend design.

                                <p>In this video, Hitesh introduces the basics of HTML

                                    <br> development.
                                    He explains the simple structure of an HTML document, which is divided
                                    into two main sections: the head and the body. The head contains
                                    metadata,<br>
                                    such as the document title, while the body contains visible content like

                                    Hitesh also discusses the use of VS Code and its Emmet abbreviation

                                    making development more efficient. He walks through the creation of a
                                    basic webpage, covering elements like the doctype, <br>
                                    which declares the version of HTML5, and the title and h1 tags.
                                    Additionally, Hitesh highlights the importance of writing semantic HTML

                                    that works across various platforms, including screen readers and
                                    in-flight entertainment systems, ensuring accessibility and cross-device
                                    <br>compatibility.

                                <p>In this video, Hitesh introduces the basics of HTML
                                    (Hypertext Markup Language), one of the most essential elements of web
                                    <br> development.
                                    He explains the simple structure of an HTML document, which is divided
                                    into two main sections: the head and the body. The head contains
                                    metadata,<br>
                                    such as the document title, while the body contains visible content like
                                    headings (h1) and paragraphs. <br>
                                    Hitesh also discusses the use of VS Code and its Emmet abbreviation
                                    shortcuts to quickly generate HTML boilerplate code,<br>
                                    making development more efficient. He walks through the creation of a
                                    basic webpage, covering elements like the doctype, <br>
                                    which declares the version of HTML5, and the title and h1 tags.
                                    Additionally, Hitesh highlights the importance of writing semantic HTML

                                    <br>compatibility.

                                <p>In this video, Hitesh introduces the basics of HTML
                                    (Hypertext Markup Language), one of the most essential elements of web
                                    <br> development.
                                    He explains the simple structure of an HTML document, which is divided
                                    into two main sections: the head and the body. The head contains
                                    metadata,<br>
                                    such as the document title, while the body contains visible content like
                                    headings (h1) and paragraphs. <br>
                                    Hitesh also discusses the use of VS Code and its Emmet abbreviation
                                    shortcuts to quickly generate HTML boilerplate code,<br>
                                    making development more efficient. He walks through the creation of a
                                    basic webpage, covering elements like the doctype, <br>
                                    which declares the version of HTML5, and the title and h1 tags.
                                    Additionally, Hitesh highlights the importance of writing semantic HTML
                                    <br>
                                    that works across various platforms, including screen readers and
                                    in-flight entertainment systems, ensuring accessibility and cross-device
                                    <br>compatibility.
                                    The video provides a strong foundation for understanding HTML structure
                                    and paves the way for exploring more advanced tags and web development
                                    techniques <br>
                                    in upcoming lessons. It's an excellent introduction for anyone starting
                                    with web development or frontend design.

                                    He explains the simple structure of an HTML document, which is divided
                                    into two main sections: the head and the body. The head contains
                                    metadata,<br>
                                    such as the document title, while the body contains visible content like
                                    headings (h1) and paragraphs. <br>
                                    Hitesh also discusses the use of VS Code and its Emmet abbreviation
                                    shortcuts to quickly generate HTML boilerplate code,<br>
                                    making development more efficient. He walks through the creation of a
                                    basic webpage, covering elements like the doctype, <br>
                                    which declares the version of HTML5, and the title and h1 tags.
                                    Additionally, Hitesh highlights the importance of writing semantic HTML

                                    <br>compatibility.
